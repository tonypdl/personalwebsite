            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>Hello! I am Tony Ponce de Leon. I am, first and foremost, an experienced educator at Cinco Ranch High School. I am also a freelance data analyst with experience in various fields.</p>

        <section id="school-board">
            <h2>CONSIDERING A RUN FOR KATY ISD SCHOOL BOARD TRUSTEE</h2>
            <p>As a dedicated member of the Katy ISD community and someone deeply passionate about education, I am exploring the possibility of running for a trustee position on the Katy ISD School Board in the upcoming May 2025 election.</p>
            <p>I believe every student deserves a high-quality education, and I am committed to supporting policies that will continue to improve our schools and foster an environment where students and educators thrive. With my background in education, data science, and community involvement, I aim to bring fresh perspectives and a strong sense of collaboration to the board.</p>
            <p>My unique perspective as a teacher without children in the school system allows me to focus solely on the best interests of our educational community. My wife, Jennifer, is a proud Taylor High School alum; she serves the community as a therapist in the Katy area, helping our youth with their mental health and creating a more confident young population in the district. I am dedicated to making data-driven decisions that benefit everyone in the district and creating an inclusive, supportive environment where every student and staff member can thrive.</p>
            <p>Over the next few months, I will be engaging with community members, listening to their concerns, and sharing my vision for the future of Katy ISD. Please join me on this journey and stay updated as I explore this opportunity.</p>
            <p>Feel free to reach out if you have thoughts or questions or want to connect. Your input is invaluable, and I look forward to hearing from you as I explore this exciting possibility.</p>
            <p>Stay tuned for more updates!</p>
