            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Tony Ponce de Leon, an educator and freelance data analyst with extensive experience in various sectors including public education and data work with the Census Bureau, the National Weather Service, and the architecture retail sector in the Houston area.</p>

            <h2>Considering a Run for Katy ISD School Board Trustee</h2>
            <p>As a dedicated member of the Katy ISD community and someone deeply passionate about education, I am currently exploring the possibility of running for a trustee position on the Katy ISD School Board in the upcoming May 2025 election.</p>
            <p>I believe that every student deserves a high-quality education, and Iâ€™m committed to supporting policies that will continue to improve our schools and foster an environment where both students and educators thrive. With my background in education, data science, and community involvement, I aim to bring fresh perspectives and a strong sense of collaboration to the board.</p>
            <p>Over the next few months, I will be engaging with community members, listening to their concerns, and sharing my vision for the future of Katy ISD. I invite you to join me in this journey and stay updated as I explore this opportunity.</p>
            <p>My unique perspective as a teacher without children in the school system allows me to focus solely on the best interests of our educational community. My wife, Jennifer, is a proud Taylor High School alum; she currently serves the community as a therapist in the Katy area helping our youth with their mental health and creating a more confident young population in the district. I am dedicated to making data-driven decisions that benefit everyone in the district and to creating an inclusive, supportive environment where every student and staff member can thrive.</p>
            <p>If you have thoughts, questions, or would like to connect, feel free to reach out. Your input is invaluable, and I look forward to hearing from you as I explore this exciting possibility.</p>
            <p>Stay tuned for more updates!</p>
